## MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION

### Analytics to Track
- [ ] Affiliate link click-through rate (by destination)
- [ ] Product click distribution (which products get clicked)
- [ ] Featured vs non-featured performance
- [ ] Mobile vs desktop engagement
- [ ] Category performance (Footwear vs Electronics vs Guides)

### A/B Testing Opportunities
1. **Module Position:**
   - Current: After photo gallery
   - Test: Above photo gallery (higher on page)

2. **Product Count:**
   - Current: 4 products
   - Test: 3 products (less overwhelming?)

3. **Call-to-Action:**
   - Current: "View" with external icon
   - Test: "Shop Now" or "See Price"

4. **Featured Badge:**
   - Current: Yellow star badge
   - Test: "Bestseller" text badge

### Optimization Recommendations
1. **Seasonal Rotation:**
   - Winter: Promote ski gear for Park City
   - Summer: Promote hiking gear for national parks
   - Update via `active` flag (no code changes)

2. **Price Optimization:**
   - Monitor which price ranges convert best
   - Test premium ($300+) vs budget ($50-100) products

3. **Image Quality:**
   - A/B test product photos vs lifestyle photos
   - Current: Mix of both (Unsplash placeholders)

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Gear Module Doesn't Appear
1. **Check API response:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-site/api/destinations/gear?id=UUID"
   ```
   - Should return JSON array (not empty)

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Open DevTools â†’ Console
   - Look for errors from `AffiliateGearModule`
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls

3. **Check destination ID:**
   - Module requires `destination.id` to be present
   - Verify destination data includes UUID

### If Products Don't Display
1. **Check `active` flag:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM destination_affiliate_gear WHERE active = false;
   ```
   - Only active products are shown

2. **Check destination_id match:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM destination_affiliate_gear
   WHERE destination_id = 'YOUR-UUID';
   ```
   - Verify products exist for that destination
