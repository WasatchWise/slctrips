## INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR SLCTRIPS

### Option 1: Import as TK-000 (Reference Implementation)
**Use Case:** Demo/template for how premium TripKits should be structured

**Migration Path:**
1. Import 29 county destinations to `tripkits` table (when created)
2. Create "Mt. Olympians Educational TripKit" as `tripkit_id: 0` (or similar)
3. Junction table: Map 29 counties to this TripKit
4. Price: $49-79 (teacher edition) or FREE (sample counties)
5. Tag: "Education", "4th Grade", "Teachers", "Field Trips"

**Benefits:**
- Instant content for TripKit Marketplace
- Proven data model for educational kits
- Reference for learning objectives structure
- AR/AI features as premium differentiators

### Option 2: Extract Data Models Only
**Use Case:** Steal the schema, not the content

**What to Extract:**
- `Guardian` interface → Add to SLCTrips destination schema (optional storytelling layer)
- `FieldTripStop` interface → Enhance destination detail pages
- `Activity` interface → Add hands-on activities to destinations
- `LearningObjectives` → Target educational market
- AR data structure → Future feature for SLCTrips

**Benefits:**
- Richer destination data model
- Educational market positioning
- Interactive features roadmap

### Option 3: Hybrid - Educational TripKit + Data Model
**Recommended Approach:**

**Phase 3A: Schema Enhancement**
1. Add optional fields to `destinations` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE destinations ADD COLUMN guardian JSONB;
   ALTER TABLE destinations ADD COLUMN learning_objectives JSONB;
   ALTER TABLE destinations ADD COLUMN field_trip_stops JSONB;
   ALTER TABLE destinations ADD COLUMN activities JSONB;
   ALTER TABLE destinations ADD COLUMN ar_data JSONB;
   ```

2. Keep existing destination data clean (no guardians)
3. Create separate TripKit for educational content

**Phase 3B: TripKit Import**
1. Create `Mt. Olympians TripKit` in `tripkits` table
2. Import 29 counties as linked destinations (or create educational variants)
3. Price: $49 (teacher edition with lesson plans)
4. Market: Teachers, homeschool parents, educational groups

**Phase 3C: AI/AR Features (Future)**
1. Gemini API integration for interactive storytelling
2. AR experiences using camera API
3. Premium feature tier

- ❗ **Curriculum Changes:** Utah Core Standards may change (content becomes outdated)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ **AI Costs:** Gemini API not free for production use
- ⚠️ **AR Complexity:** Camera permissions, browser compatibility issues
- ⚠️ **Content Maintenance:** 29 counties require updates (safety notes, GPS, etc.)

### Low Risk
- ✅ **Data Model Import:** Schema is well-designed and reusable
- ✅ **Technical Stack:** Compatible with SLCTrips (React/TS/Vite)
- ✅ **Component Reuse:** Pages/components easily portable
